\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Defines an abstract base class for sequential containers with index-\/based access. 

The {\ttfamily serial} class is intended to be used as a base for containers that support index-\/based access, such as arrays, lists, and other data structures where elements can be accessed via an index. Derived classes are required to implement certain methods such as {\ttfamily get()}, {\ttfamily operator\mbox{[}\mbox{]}}, {\ttfamily set()}, and {\ttfamily index\+Of()}. This class offers methods for safely accessing elements, including negative index handling and bounds checking.
